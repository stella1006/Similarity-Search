Fisrt of all, I have read some papers related to KNN graph, such as HNSW and NNDES. I also read papers about PQ. I learned about the idea of the Norm-layered KNN graph for MIPS and recently I worked on some experienments to compare performance of L2 metric  and Innerproduct on HNSW and NNDES. Liu jie is programming for this algorithm and I will also try to help with him.
